# Smart Notification Engine

A Flask-based web application that analyses energy supplier customer data from multiple sources and generates AI-powered, targeted notifications focusing on Value Seekers customers.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Customer Analysis**: Uses AWS Bedrock to analyze customer behavior and generate priority recommendations
- **Multi-Table Data Integration**: Combines data from 5 different sources for comprehensive customer profiles

- **Trigger Factor Analysis**: AI identifies specific data points that warrant customer contact
- **SQLite Database**: Efficient local database with proper relationships and indexing

## Database Structure

The system uses 5 tables created from CSV files:
- **customer_profiles**: Basic customer information and AI-classified segments
- **account_activity**: Account status, engagement scores, churn risk
- **interaction_history**: Customer service interactions and sentiment
- **notification_history**: Past notification performance and engagement
- **recommended_actions**: System-generated action recommendations
