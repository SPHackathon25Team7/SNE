# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Simplify customer data retrieval and filtering

  - Add clear opt-in checking before any processing
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_






- [ ] 2. Create focused AI priority analyzer
  - [ ] 2.1 Design clear, structured AI prompt for customer priority analysis
    - Create prompt template that requests specific priority, urgency, and insights

    - Ensure prompt asks for structured response format for reliable parsing
    - Include customer context (churn risk, billing issues, engagement) in prompt
    - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.3_

  - [x] 2.2 Implement structured response parser for AI priority analysis

    - Parse AI response into priority, urgency, risk score, and insights
    - Add validation to ensure all required fields are present
    - Handle malformed AI responses gracefully


    - _Requirements: 6.4, 7.3_


  - [ ] 2.3 Add fallback logic for AI priority analysis failures
    - Implement rule-based priority assignment using churn risk and billing issues
    - Ensure fallback provides same data structure as AI analysis
    - Log when fallback logic is used for monitoring

    - _Requirements: 6.5, 7.1, 7.2_

- [x] 3. Create focused AI message generator


  - [x] 3.1 Design clear AI prompt for personalized message generation

    - Create prompt template for engagement-focused messages
    - Specify British English and Value Seekers tone requirements
    - Include customer context and priority analysis in prompt
    - _Requirements: 6.2, 3.3, 3.4_


  - [ ] 3.2 Implement message generation with channel-specific formatting
    - Generate messages appropriate for Email, SMS, App Push, Phone
    - Ensure messages are concise and action-oriented for Value Seekers
    - Add fallback template messages for AI failures
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.5_


- [ ] 4. Streamline notification orchestration workflow
  - [x] 4.1 Simplify the main notification generation method

    - Remove complex customer analysis loops

    - Focus on: get customers → analyze priority → generate message → assemble notification
    - Add clear error handling at each step
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 4.1, 4.2_

  - [x] 4.2 Implement customer contact decision logic

    - Use AI priority analysis to determine if customer should be contacted
    - Focus on high churn risk, billing issues, and low engagement
    - Respect opt-in status and avoid notification fatigue
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.3, 4.4_




  - [ ] 4.3 Create comprehensive notification data structure
    - Include customer details, priority analysis, message, and service insights
    - Ensure all data needed for customer service agents is present
    - Add customer context and resolution strategies
    - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_


- [ ] 5. Enhance error handling and reliability
  - [ ] 5.1 Add comprehensive error logging
    - Log all AI service calls and responses
    - Log database errors and fallback usage
    - Include customer ID and timestamp in all logs
    - _Requirements: 7.2, 7.4_

  - [ ] 5.2 Implement graceful degradation for service failures
    - Handle AI service unavailability with fallback logic
    - Handle database connection issues with retry logic
    - Ensure system continues to operate with reduced functionality
    - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.4_

- [ ] 6. Update API endpoints and data structure
  - [ ] 6.1 Modify notifications API endpoint to return new data structure
    - Update /api/notifications endpoint to use simplified workflow
    - Ensure response includes all customer service insights
    - Maintain backward compatibility where possible
    - _Requirements: 2.4, 2.5_

  - [ ] 6.2 Test and validate API responses
    - Verify all required fields are present in API responses
    - Test error handling for various failure scenarios
    - Ensure British English is used throughout responses
    - _Requirements: 3.3, 7.3, 7.4_

- [ ]* 7. Create comprehensive test suite
  - [ ]* 7.1 Write unit tests for AI prompt construction and response parsing
    - Test priority analysis prompt generation with various customer data
    - Test message generation prompt construction
    - Test AI response parsing with valid and invalid responses
    - _Requirements: 6.3, 6.4_

  - [ ]* 7.2 Write integration tests for complete notification workflow
    - Test end-to-end notification generation with real database
    - Test AI service integration and fallback scenarios
    - Test API endpoint responses and data structure
    - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.3, 7.4_

  - [ ]* 7.3 Create test data and scenarios for various customer types
    - Create test customers with different risk profiles
    - Test high churn risk, billing issues, and low engagement scenarios
    - Verify appropriate prioritization and messaging for each type
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 4.1, 4.2_
